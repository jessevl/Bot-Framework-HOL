#Microsoft Bot Framework Hands-On Lab: Mars Challenge

Welcome to the Mars Challenge. The Mars Challenge is a series of hands-on labs with a twist to it... You will be briefed on your missions later on in the lab. 

**Please do NOT click into any other pages in this repo until told to do so!**

###Prerequisites (try to do before the lab starts)

- Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/). After you've installed this, open your command line and run `npm install npm -g`. This updates Node's Package Manager (npm) to the latest version.
- Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (or any other code editor of your choice)
- Install [Bot Framework emulator](https://emulator.botframework.com)

###Lab content

Start with Mission 1.
- [**Mission 1:**](MISSION1.md) Creating the bot and linking to LUIS
- [**Mission 2:**](MISSION2.md) Getting news from Earth through the bot
- [**Mission 3:**](MISSION3.md) Identifying objects using the Computer Vision API (DIY Challenge)
- [**Bonus:**](BONUS.md) Connecting the bot to other channels

You can find the finished project in the [Finished](/finished/) folder but try to see whether you can get there yourself without cheating.
